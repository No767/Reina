# ✨ Reina v3.0.0 ✨

Reina v3.0.0 is a full rewrite of Reina, learning from the tips and tricks from Kumiko and Akari. This version contains tons of new changes, and how everything works. And a lot of breaking changes.

## 🔥 Breaking Changes

- **Alpine builds are not supported past v3**. This is due to many performance issues, build times costing up to 25 mins per build (50 - 100x times slower compared to Debian builds), and many other issues. `v2.4.x` is the last version that supports `-alpine` builds.
- Stop supporting `-bullseye` builds.
- The ORM now uses Tortoise ORM instead of SQLAlchemy
